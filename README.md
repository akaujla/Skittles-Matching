# Skittles-Matching
Matching game where the user must match 3 skittles in a row to earn points

The objective of the game is to keep matching skittles until they run out. If the board fills up before the skittles have run out, you lose. Everytime 3 skittles of the same colour are matched, they turn into a single skittle that is a complementary colour. For example, matching three green skittles in a row turns them into one red skittle. If the skittles run out, and the board has not been filled up, you win!
